Cappeau, a wine merchant and poet, had been asked by a parish priest to write a Christmas poem. Unitarian minister John Sullivan Dwight, editor of Dwight's Journal of Music, created a singing edition based on Cappeau's French text in 1855. In both the French original and in the two familiar English versions of the carol, the text reflects on the birth of Jesus and of humanity's redemption.\n\nLyrics\nO Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining,\nIt is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining.\nTill He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.\nA thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,\nFor yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.\nFall on your knees!

Before him lowly bend!\nBehold your King! Before him lowly bend!\n\nTruly He taught us to love one another,\nHis law is love and His gospel is peace.\nChains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.\nAnd in his name all oppression shall cease.\nSweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,\nWith all our hearts we praise His holy name.\nChrist is the Lord!

Cappeau, a wine merchant and poet, had been asked by a parish priest to write a Christmas poem. Unitarian minister John Sullivan Dwight, editor of Dwight's Journal of Music, created a singing edition based on Cappeau's French text in 1855.
