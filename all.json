Cappeau, a wine merchant and poet, had been asked by a parish priest to write a Christmas poem.

Before him lowly bend!\nBehold your King! Before him lowly bend!\n\nTruly He taught us to love one another,\nHis law is love and His gospel is peace.\nChains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.\nAnd in his name all oppression shall cease.\nSweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,\nWith all our hearts we praise His holy name.\nChrist is the Lord!

It is probably one of his most popular pieces. Oddly enough, Mozart never published 'Eine Kleine Nachtmusik' in his lifetime. It was left up to his widow, Constanze, to sell it in a job lot of his music to a publisher in 1799, presumably to raise much needed cash. It saw public light of day only in 1827, some forty years after it was written.\nScore Type: Beginner Arrangement for Piano solo\nScore Key: C major (Sounding Pitch) (View more C major Music for Piano )\nTempo Marking:\nTime Signature: 4/4 (View more 4/4 Music)\nDuration: 1:26\nNumber of Pages: 2\nDifficulty: Beginners Level: Recommended for Beginners\nTags:\n classical    beginner piano    18th century    beginners  "}{"Artist":"Mozart","Titles":"Turkish March","Difficulties":"Easy Level","AllLinks":"/scores/447.asp","MIDILinks":"https://www.8notes.com/school/midi/piano/mozart_turkish_march.mid","photoLinks1":"https://www.8notes.com/school/png/piano/mozart_turkish_march001.png","photoLinks2":null,"sheetDesc":"About 'Turkish March'\n\n\nArtist:\nMozart, Wolfgang Amadeus (biography)\nBorn:\nJanuary 27, 1756 , December 5, 1791\nDied:\nSalzburg , Vienna\nThe Artist:\nA child prodigy, Mozart wrote his first symphony when he was eight years old and his first opera at 12.
